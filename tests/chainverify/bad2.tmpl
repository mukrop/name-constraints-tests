==== Certificate chain template file ====
# Only files prefixed by a single digit+colon are processed.
# Template directives should be in certtool format.
# A chain in ascending number order will be created (cert 0 is self-signed)
# Certificate number 0-9 is allowed.

==== Description and outcome ====
# These lines may be processed by testing script, don't change prefixes.
